      <description>Why I&amp;rsquo;m learning Rust? Basically, I was planning on studying compilers, interpreters and how programming languages work on the low level part.&#xA;I tought that Rust was a good choice because it has large and active open source community, and it&amp;rsquo;s simpler than C and C++. I had sometime in last year learning C, was a pain in the ass, but I recognize the impact that it had in my understanding of how a computer memory works on the low level.</description>
